###Preliminary Steps for our code to run:

####In Virtual Machine:
Get the VirtualBox running by logging in. You will need to run the following commands:

sudo apt-get install ipython ipython-notebook python-pip

sudo pip install gspread

sudo apt-get install python-pandas

vi ~/stat157.cfg  ### Edit the code so that it contains your username and password. This will open up the vi editor. 
You want stat157.cfg to have the same format as the one shown in this repository. Type vimtutor in your virtual machine 
for a tutorial of how to use vi if you don't already know how to do so.

ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 ###This initiates ipython notebook in your browser. To access it, open up 
your browser and enter your specific ip address, which can be found in the settings of your virtual box.
